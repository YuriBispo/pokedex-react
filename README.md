# pokedex-react
A practice repo based on pokemon's pokedex.

## What am I trying to do?
I'm practicing React concepts like components, props, state, lifecycle, HOC, hooks, etc... So, it's not like a REAL LIFE application, but I'll use the best practices for each scenario.

## That's it?
Yeah, bro! I'm just studying ;]
